MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your normal Chrome browser.

For Dapp connect to the ethereum network, it needs to connect Ethereum Client or node and this Ethereum node will have access to the ethereum network. Typically , both the dapp and node will run in the same computer.

For instance, take example of standard Ethereum Wallet  \( available from ethereum site\). Ethereum wallet launches goeth client to connect to ethereum network. Same way, any dapp you write needs a node to connect to the ethereum network.
