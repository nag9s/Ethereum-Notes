MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your normal Chrome browser.

For Dapp connect to the ethereum network, it needs to connect Ethereum Client or node and this Ethereum node will have access to the ethereum network. Typically , both the dapp and node will run in the same computer.
