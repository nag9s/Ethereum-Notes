There are two types of arrays in Solidity: _**fixed **\_arrays and _**dynamic **\_arrays:



// Array with a fixed length of 2 elements:

uint\[2\] fixedArray;

// another fixed Array, can contain 5 strings:

string\[5\] stringArray;

// a dynamic Array - has no fixed size, can keep growing:

uint\[\] dynamicArray;

You can also create an array of structs. Using the previous chapter's Person struct:



Person\[\] people; // dynamic Array, we can keep adding to it

Remember that state variables are stored permanently in the blockchain? So creating a dynamic array of structs like this can be useful for storing structured data in your contract, kind of like a database.

**Public Arrays**

You can declare an array as public, and Solidity will automatically create a getter method for it. The syntax looks like:



Person\[\] public people;

Other contracts would then be able to read \(but not write\) to this array. So this is a useful pattern for storing public data in your contract.
